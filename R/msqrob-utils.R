#' Smallest unique protein groups

#' @description For a given vector of protein group names, outputs the names of those protein groups for which none of its member proteins is present in a smaller protein group.
#' @param proteins A vector of characters or factors containing single proteins and/or protein groups (i.e. proteins separated by a separator symbol).
#' @param split The character string that is used to separate the indivudual protein names in each protein group.
#' @return A character vector containing the names of the protein groups for which none of its proteins is present in a smaller protein group.

#' Make contrast matrix
#'
#' @description  Construct the contrast matrix corresponding to specified contrasts
#'               of a set of parameters.
#'
#' @param contrasts: character vector specifying contrasts, i.e. the linear combination of the modelparameters that equals to zero.
#'
#' @param parameterNames: character vector specifying the model parameters that are involved in the contrasts, e.g if we model data of
#'        three conditions using a factor condition with three levels a, b and c then our model will have 3 mean parameters named (Intercept),
#'        conditionb and conditionc. Hence the log2 fold change between  b and a is conditionb. Under the null hypothesis the log2 fold change
#'        equals 0. Which is to be encoded as "conditionb=0". If we would like to test for log2 fold change between condition c and b we assess if
#'        the log2 fold change conditionc-conditionb equals 0, encoded as "condtionb-conditionc=0".
#'
#' @examples
#' makeContrast(c("conditionb=0"),parameterNames=c("(Intercept)","conditionb","conditionc"))
#' makeContrast(c("conditionc=b"),parameterNames=c("conditionB"))
#' makeContrast(c("conditionb=0","conditionc=0","conditionc-conditionb=0"),parameterNames=c("conditionb","conditionc"))
#'
#' @return A numeric contrast matrix with rownames that equal the model parameters that are involved in the contrasts
